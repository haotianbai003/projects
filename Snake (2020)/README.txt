Classic snake game made in 2020 using JavaFX.

- snake can teleport up/down/left/right with WASD
- player can choose to save highscore permanently or discard their highscore upon quitting (i.e.: revert to 0)
- while game is in play, player can freely toggle between the 3 levels by pressing 1/2/3 while keeping their snake and score as is (as long as snake is alive)
